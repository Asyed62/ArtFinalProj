# 100 word Artist Statement
I've chosen to name this piece 'Passing Time'.
I wanted to try and capture a familiar feeling/experience
that I'm sure everyone, including myself, has gone through,
which is sitting in your room all day watching time pass by
without even realizing how fast the day has gone by.
I portrayed this by using images/shapes to draw a room
and a window in which the sun and moon repeatedly rotate.
I also drew a digital clock to further emphasize the way
in which time flies without us realizing it.
I primarily drew inspiration  from the thumbnails
of the 'lofi hip hop' videos on youtube,
as well as 'study room day' by Ana Rocha.
